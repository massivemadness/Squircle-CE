## Build instructions

### Prerequisites

* At least **1,11GB** of free disk space: **144,7MB** for source codes and around **965,3MB** for
  files generated after building all variants
* **4GB** of RAM
* **macOS** or **Linux**-based operating system. **Windows** platform is supported by
  using [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/).

### Building

1. `$ git clone --recursive --depth=1 --shallow-submodules https://github.com/massivemadness/Squircle-CE Squircle-CE`
   â€” clone **Squircle CE** with submodules
2. In case you forgot the `--recursive` flag, `cd` into `Squircle-CE` directory
   and: `$ git submodule init && git submodule update --init --recursive --depth=1`
3. Create `local.properties` file with the following properties:  
   `KEYSTORE_PATH`: absolute path to the keystore file  
   `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: password for the keystore  
   `KEY_ALIAS`: key alias that will be used to sign the app  
   `KEY_PASSWORD`: key password  
   **Warning**: keep this file safe and make sure nobody, except you, has access to it.
4. `$ cd Squircle-CE`
5. Now you can open the project using **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)** or
   build manually from the command line: `./gradlew assembleRelease`.
